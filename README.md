# Health Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a disease (diabetes) using patient health metrics.
A logistic regression model is used due to its interpretability and effectiveness for binary classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Involved
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation and prediction

## Result
The model achieves approximately 75–80% accuracy depending on data split.
